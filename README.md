# Suvidha_Foundation

This project is a web application developed for Suvidha Foundation, a non-profit organization, to facilitate their admission process for various courses offered by them. The web application allows users to sign up, register for courses, and submit their resumes. The application is built using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application consists of three main pages: Home, Sign-in, and Dashboard. The Home page provides information about the foundation and the courses they offer. The Sign-in page allows users to sign in with their credentials or create a new account if they are a new user. The Dashboard page is where users can select the course they want to register for and upload their resume.

The application uses an Excel file as a database to store user information such as username, password, course selected, and resume file name. The Excel file is styled using the OpenPyXL library to increase font size, adjust column widths and row heights, and make it visually appealing.

The application's backend uses Python Flask to handle requests and responses from the client-side. The routes are defined in the Flask application, which includes functionality to sign in, register, and upload files.

Overall, this project provides an efficient and user-friendly way for Suvidha Foundation to manage their admission process and for users to register for courses and submit their resumes.
